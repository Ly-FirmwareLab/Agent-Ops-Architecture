# Agent-Ops-Architecture

**A top-level design for Distributed Embodied AI — one person, commanding a team of agents, driving countless physical nodes.**

This repository is the **blueprint** of the Agent Ops trio. It contains **documentation only — no code**.
It answers *why the system is shaped this way*, not *how to install it*.

## The trio

| Repository | Plane | In one sentence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **This repo** · `Agent-Ops-Architecture` | **Blueprint** | The top-level design for distributed embodied AI, the manifesto, and the human-agent conventions | Public |
| [`Agent-Ops-WeCom-Bridge`](https://github.com/Ly-FirmwareLab/Agent-Ops-WeCom-Bridge) | **Control plane** · human ⇄ agent | Turns WeCom into an agent cockpit: streaming interaction, progress control, permission interception | Public |
| [`Agent-Ops-Edge-Hub`](https://github.com/Ly-FirmwareLab/Agent-Ops-Edge-Hub) | **Data plane** · agent ⇄ physical world | An MQTT-based edge bus that turns agent intent into real device actions | Public |

The control plane and the data plane are **fully decoupled** — they never call each other, they only share one set of conventions.

## The thesis

**AI is trapped in the digital world.** Model output is tokens, not actions.

There are two common replies, and both fall short:

- *Put the model on the device* → not enough compute, slow to iterate, dead when offline.
- *Expose a cloud API* → the device becomes a networked switch, with no local judgment and no fallback.

Both share the same wrong assumption: **intelligence and body must be the same thing.**

Our answer is to **decouple them**:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Cloud** | Model inference, complex planning, capability iteration |
| **Edge** | A concentrated brain (agents) plus an always-on hub (bus, adapters, alarms) |
| **End** | Distributed embodied nodes — panels, robots, sensors — each with a small local judgment of its own |

Three design principles:

1. **Central brain, distributed bodies.** Compute is scarce; devices are cheap.
2. **Narrow channel, hard contract.** Frame caps, idempotent commands, cooldowns, honest timeouts — because physical actions cannot be rolled back.
3. **Graceful degradation, edge autonomy.** When the brain goes down, devices must keep doing what they already know how to do. **Continuity matters more than intelligence.**

The acceptance test is one sentence: **unplug the network — can the device still do the few things it already knows?**

## What is actually built

Stated plainly, so the claim and the evidence are on the same page:

- ✅ Brain/body decoupling — running: panel and robot actions are dispatched over MQTT with two-way receipts.
- ✅ Contracted channel — frame caps, QoS 1 end-to-end, idempotent dedupe, cooldowns, concurrency gate, honest timeouts.
- ✅ Device isolation — mutual TLS, topic-scoped ACLs, one credential pair per device.
- 🟡 Edge autonomy — **partial**: device firmware and local entry points survive without the bus; automatic takeover after brain loss is not implemented.
- ✅ Heterogeneous onboarding — the third device type was added by copying an existing adapter, in half a day.
- ❌ Production-grade resilience — no redundancy, no SLA, no failure drills.

**This is an architecture position, not a production guarantee.**
